This GitHub repository was only created on 14/11/25. I have unfortunately taken a long time to figure out how to sync this repository with my PyCharm project meanwhile working on it. ANYWAYS. I hope you enjoy this Queensland crime tracker that I have created to help people for all purposes.
I think I'm also using it myself, so I know where NOT to go next time on a bike.

#add how to download the file and run on pycharm.
